## The goal of the analysis
### Our goal is to visualize the data from imdb by making a dashboard and use it to show the relationship between the number of movies with high quality and their rating, year, genre and popularity. We assumed that a high rating is proportional to the high quality of the movie and a high number of votes is proportional to the popularity of the movie. In order to facilitate the analysis, we scraped the data of high score moviesÂ in the past 50 years into our database.
